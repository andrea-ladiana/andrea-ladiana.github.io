                <p>
                    I am broadly interested in memory systems and collective behaviour. I work with models where many
                    simple units, when connected in the right way, can store patterns, retrieve them, and support each
                    other's computations. This includes classical and modern associative networks, multi-layer
                    architectures where different modules communicate, and abstract "memory fields" that can be analysed
                    with tools from mathematics, statistical physics, and machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recurring theme in my work is cooperation across modules: how several interacting memories can
                    jointly denoise signals, disentangle overlapping information, or build a shared representation, and
                    how this behaviour changes when the system is distributed, noisy, or evolving. I like to push these
                    ideas beyond standard neural-network settings – towards biological and immune systems, where
                    repertoires and populations behave like diffuse memories, and towards more exploratory applications
                    involving biomes and complex interacting populations shaped by many local interactions over time.

                    I spend most of my free time folding paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main hobby is <strong>origami</strong>, especially
                    <strong>modular designs</strong> and floral
                    models. I'm particularly fond of modular origami, constructions
                    made from many repeated units that lock
                    together into geometric structures ( see, for example, the <a
                        href="https://origami.kosmulski.org/types/modular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">origami by
                        Michał Kosmulski</a>) I also admire the clean and structural
                    approach of <strong>Tomoko
                        Fuse</strong>,
                    whose books on unit origami and geometric models helped shape
                    how I think about paper as a medium for
                    building mathematical objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the more organic side, I love floral origami. One of my
                    all-time favourite diagrams is the
                    <strong>Pentagon Rose</strong> by <strong>Naomiki Sato</strong>
                    (<a href="https://markjgillespie.com/Origami/Sato_Rose_Notes.pdf" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">diagram</a>), a rose built
                    from a pentagonal base
                    that manages to look surprisingly natural while still being very
                    structured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point I started trying to put these two worlds together
                    and I am slowly
                    writing a children's book about origami and mathematics (but
                    more generally deals with the connection
                    between the former and physics, biology, art, and culture). The
                    idea is to show how
                    symmetry, counting, and geometry hide inside folds, in a way
                    that is playful rather than intimidating.
                    It is very much a side project and progresses in bursts whenever
                    time allows, but it remains one of the
                    long-term things I'd like to complete.
